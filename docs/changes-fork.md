# Notable changes compared to Finn's Launcher

µLauncher is a fork of [finnmglas's app Launcher](https://github.com/finnmglas/Launcher).
Here is an incomplete list of changes:
<!--The last commit of the original project is [340ee731](https://github.com/jrpie/launcher/commit/340ee7315293b028c060638e058516435bca296a)
The first commit of µLauncher is [cc2e7710](https://github.com/jrpie/launcher/commit/cc2e7710c824549c367d97a81a1646d27c6c8993),
which at the time was still intended as a patch for launcher.
The decision to create a hard fork was made two years later.-->

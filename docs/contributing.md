* If you found a bug or have an idea for a new feature, you can [join the chat][chat] or open an [issue][issues].

    > Please note that I work on this project in my free time. Thus, I might not respond immediately, and not all ideas will be implemented.

* You can implement a new feature yourself:
  - Create a [fork][fork] of this repository.
  - Create a new branch named `feature/<your feature>` or `fix/<your fix>` and commit your changes.
  - Open a new pull request.


See [here](/docs/build) for instructions on how to build this project.
The [CI pipeline](https://github.com/jrpie/Launcher/actions) automatically creates debug builds.

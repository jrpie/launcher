# Showing Apps on the Home Screen

Even though this is somewhat contrary to the general idea of &mu;Launcher,
it is possible to show apps on the home screen using widgets.

Users suggested:
* [Launchy](https://launchywidget.com/) (proprietary!)
* KWGT Kustom Widget Maker (proprietary!)

Both of these apps are not open source and KWGT even has ads.

Please contact me if you know FOSS alternatives!

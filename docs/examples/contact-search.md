# Contact Search

&mu;Launcher does not implement a contact search feature.
This is a [deliberate decision](/docs/declined-features#search-contacts) to keep &mu;Launcher minimal.
However, there are several other options to search your contacts:


## Contacts App

Probably your preinstalled contacts app already provides a search feature.
This might however require one or two additional clicks to navigate to the search.
[Key Mapper](#key-mapper) can serve as a workaround.


## Blue Line Console

[Blue Line Console](https://github.com/nhirokinet/bluelineconsole) provides a general purpose search.


## KISS Launcher's search

[KISS Launcher](https://kisslauncher.com) is itself a formidable minimal launcher following a slightly different philosophy.[^1]
If you prefer KISS's search feature, but also want to use &mu;Launcher's gesture-based home screen, you can set &mu;Launcher as your home screen, configure KISS Launcher to launch directly into search
(KISS settings > User experience > Keyboard options > Display keyboard on start) and bind KISS to a gesture.

## Key Mapper

[Key Mapper](https://github.com/keymapperorg/KeyMapper) is a very versatile tool to automate all kinds of tasks.
Usually, these actions are triggered by certain key presses,
but you can also use a pinned shortcut as a trigger.
For example, this allows to automate the process of launching the contacts app and opening the search.

[^1]: See [this list](/docs/alternatives/) for an overview of other launchers.

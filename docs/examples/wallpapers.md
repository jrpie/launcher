# Wallpapers

Some other launchers, notably [OLauncher](/docs/alternatives/#olauncher),
have an option to show daily changing wallpapers.

Aiming for [composability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy),
&mu;Launcher simply shows the wallpaper set by the system.
You can use [Live Wallpapers](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2010/02/live-wallpapers.html) for
daily changing wallpapers, slideshows and the like.
Furthermore, there exist apps which automatically change the system wallpaper,
for example [Wall You](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.bnyro.wallpaper/).

Many [open source options](https://search.f-droid.org/?q=wallpaper) exist.
I can recommend:
* [Slideshow Wallpaper](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/io.github.doubi88.slideshowwallpaper/)
* [Shader Editor](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.markusfisch.android.shadereditor/) lets you write custom GLSL shaders and use them as a live wallpaper.

Note that apps that offer daily wallpapers, e.g. [Wall You](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.bnyro.wallpaper/),
usually download them from to proprietary sources.

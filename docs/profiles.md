# Work Profile

µLauncher is compatible with [work profile](https://www.android.com/enterprise/work-profile/), so apps like [Shelter](https://gitea.angry.im/PeterCxy/Shelter) can be used.
Apps from the work profile are shown in the usual app list.


# Private Space

µLauncher is compatible with [private space](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/private-space).


The private space can be (un)locked by a dedicated action.

It is configurable whether apps from private space are

1. shown in the usual app list
    (in this case, (un)locking is accessible through a lock icon on the top right of the app drawer)
    or
2. only shown in a separate list.
